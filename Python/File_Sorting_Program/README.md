Using the **Select folder to clean** button, you can select the folder to sort.
Using the **Select Location for New Folder** button, you can select the folder to save the folder of sorted files to.
Once a name for the saved folder is entered and the previous fields are filled, the **Continue** button should become available.

Upon pressing continue, the program will sort the files into sub-folders in the user named folder like so:

Inside the **Info** folder, you will find a .txt file that keeps track of every file sorted and what folder they were relocated to.

Currently, the **Re-Sort** button will run the last sort again.
