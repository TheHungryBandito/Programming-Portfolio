File Sorter V3 is an application that uses a 
tkinter Gui that follows this procedure:

- Browse to folder <User> would like organized.

- Browse to a folder <User> would like to place a folder to organize files to.

- Name the folder.

- Automatically create a directory using the name chosen along with folders within the
Directory with names corrosponding to file types.

- Automatically sort files in the folder <User> has chosen into the new folders based on
file types (file.endswith(".exe", ".apk") etc.)

- Generate a Text document recording the files moved and which folder they were moved to.

- Opens new folder.

Updates:
File Sorter V3 now has an improved GUI and uses a dictonary for referencing file extensions
aswell as including my new logo.

File Sorter V2 Was the first Gui Model

File Sorter OG was command line based
